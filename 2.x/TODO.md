# Bugs and To be done issues

## Easy fixable bugs

 - fix tabs on left/right
 - radious for vertical button groups
 - translations here and there
 - update side-pane navigation with real links
 - reformate document and add proper `section` tags

## Bugs

 - stack floats in low-width does not work because of specific [dir=rtl]
 - animated progress bars are too fast
 - arrow on tooltip on right/left (ex. `data-placement="left"`) and good to have on start/end
 - replace `carousel-control left` with prev/next

## Good to have

 - Submenus on dropdowns with start/end support
 - start end variation for pagination-left/pagination-right
 - add thumbnails to docs http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/components.html#thumbnails
